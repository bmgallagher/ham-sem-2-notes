## Water (a review)

```
> Water is a polar molecule
	>> it is a solvent (the universal solvent)
	>> Cohesion (water-to-water) "sticky" 
		>>> Surface tension
	>> Adhesion (water-to-polar_surface)
	>> High specific heat capacity
		>>> thermal stability
		>>> evaporative cooling
> Water potential --> Ψcell = Ψs + Ψp
	>> Water movement through diffusion

> How does water move in plants?

	>> Not a pump (Strausberger's experiment disproved pump)

	>> Not diffusion, because a 1m tall plant would need
			  8 years to get it from root to tip

	>> Not just Capillary action --> "bulk flow"

		    	phenomenon
				>>>> picric acid experiment
			>>> the Vitalists proposed some sort of vital
			    force like how animals have heartbeats
				>>>> roots not necessary --> disproved
			>>> living leaves, dead xylem
		>> Not sufficient to move water up the tree,
		   but holds it up once it's in there
		>> Could only bring up water ~3 meters

	>> Not Barometric model -- Trees act like barometers
		>>> being sucked up by pressure difference
		>>> 1 atmosphere == 1 bar == 0.1 mPa --> not enough
			>>>> 1 atm only lifts water 10 meters
		>>> Suction doesn't happen

## The W Questions

### Who?

Photoautotrophs

- Many bacteria such as cyanobacteria, purple sulfur, etc.

  - Endosymbotic theory -- prokaryotes were engulfed to become chloroplasts

- "Algae"

  - Multicellular -- red, brown, and green

- Protists

  - Euglena
  - Unicellular Eukaryotes

- Terrestrial Plants (duh)

  ​

### What?

- Conversion of light energy to chemical energy stored in sugar (byproduct O2)



### Where?

- Chloroplasts in leaf cells in air-filled leaves (air is needed)



### When?

- When is there light? --> Light reactions always during day
  - Dark reactions are also during day except in CAM plants, where carbon fixation part can happen in the dark.



### Why?

- Way back when it was found to be a good way to make a living (see *stromatolites* (cyanobacteria))



### How?

#### 	Light vs. Dark Reactions

- The Light-dependent (photochemical) reactions

  `H2O + Light + ADP + Pi + NADP+ --> ATP + NADPH + O2`

  - Light hits pigments, excites electrons, ETC to create usable chemical energy (ATP), eventually passed off to electron carriers (NADPH) (reducing agent)
  - H2O is consumed and O2 is produced as a byproduct of this reaction.

- The "Dark" or Light-independent (biochemical) reactions

  - The Calvin cycle -- Rubisco-mediated 
  - CO2 is consumed and sugar (stable form of chemical energy) is produced in this reaction


## The History of Photosynthesis

- x BC       Ancient Greeks (Aristotle) -- "animals need plants, plants don't need animals"

- 1600      Van Helmont experiment -- Grow plant, weigh soil --> plants don't gain body mass from soil

  - He concluded that the mass came from water.

- 1720's   Stephen Hales -- thought something from the air attributed to plant mass

- 1770's   Priestly -- Mouse/candle in bell jar → Phlogistation (contamination) of air (removal of oxygen)

  ​											→ Plants dephlogistated it

  ​		Ingenhousz -- Plants only dephlogistated it in the sunlight, just phlogistated it in the dark

  ​		Senebier -- 

- 1780's   Lavoisier -- An actual chemist, determined that Oxygen and CO2 are involved with the above ↑

  - Plants produce and animals consume O2, opposite with CO2

- 1800's   de Saussure -- Plant mass is from CO2 *and* something from water

- 1840's   von Mayer -- 

- 1860's   von Sachs -- 

- 1880's   Engelmann -- Prism --> *Spirogyra* cells --> found the wavelengths used by photosynthesis

  - Discovered the Action Spectrum (Variation in action due to wavelength)

    ![Image result for engelmann experiment](http://6e.plantphys.net/ch/07/wt07.01/wt0701d.jpg)

- 1900's   Blackman -- codified the idea that light and dark reactions were separate

  - The photochemical reactions are fast, and biochemical (CO2-limited) are slow

- 1930's   van Neil -- Purple sulfur bacteria (H2S --{light}-->> S2)

  - Thus, oxygenic photosynthesis must split water.

- 1941      Ruben & Kamen -- Radioactively labled Oxygen in water

  - shows that the source of oxygen released by plants was from water.

- 1954      Arnon -- Photophosphorylation

  - Chloroplasts produce ATP

    ​





## C3 vs C4 Photosynthesis

Brian Gallagher		    3 April 2018

------

### How C3 Photosynthesis Works

1.   CO2 + RUBP --> 2 x 3-Carbon acids

   ​		| RUBP is a 5-Carbon sugar w/ 2 Phosphates

2.   3-Carbon acid(Phosphate) ----{-ATP, -NADPH}-->> 3-Carbon sugar(Phosphate)

3.   3-Carbon sugar: one goes to product (Triose Phosphate), other goes to become RUBP



### How C4 Photosynthesis Works

- There is a spatial separation of carbon fixation and sugar formation

  - Carboxylation (Carbon fixation) happens in the mesophyll

    1. ​	CO2 + 3-Carbon --> 4-Carbon (Malic acid, etc.)
    2. ​        4-Carbon compound is sent to Bundle Sheath

  - Sugar formation is happening inside the bundle sheath cells of C4 plants

    - Very high CO2 concentration in bundle sheaths

**Difference between C3 and C4 Structure:**

![Image result for c3 vs c4 structure](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HbLg4lMpUa8/maxresdefault.jpg)

- The bundle sheath in the C4 plants are large cells with chloroplasts.
  - The difference in their Photosynthesis has to do with this
    - Triose Phosphate in C3 is released into the mesophyll cytoplasm, where it is turned into sucrose (the transport sugar) to be put into a vascular bundle for transport
      - No separation, so happens throughout the Mesophyll
    - The spatial separation in C4 causes

## Chloroplast Structure

![Image result for chloroplast structure](http://alevelnotes.com/content_images/chloroplast.gif)



## How does Light work?

![Image result for electromagnetic spectrum](https://cdn.miniphysics.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/electromagneticspectrum.jpg)

​		![Image result for chlorophyll light absorption spectrum](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ec7318f0497381d8b83290f0eeaa3b23-c)

- Pigments are molecules that absorb particular wavelengths of light

  - Chlorophyll structure: porphyrin ring with metal in the middle (Mg) --> looks a lot like hemoglobin
  - Long non-polar hydrophobic tail to bind it to the thylakoid membrane

- The radiant energy of the photon is converted into heat, etc. on hitting something

  - Pigment gets excited, and...

    1. ​	release energy as Heat

    2. ​        release energy as Fluorescence (light)

    3. ​        Photochemistry --> e- is lost, chlorophyll is oxidized

    4. ​        Resonance Transfer --> transfer of excited state (without transferring electrons)

       ![Image result for energy transfer during photosynthesis](http://www.tankonyvtar.hu/en/tartalom/tamop425/0010_1A_Book_angol_01_novenyelettan/images/img26.png)

### Spectra: Absorption & Action

![Image result for action spectrum absorption spectrum](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hc4APxaI4QA/WDcWRFlsESI/AAAAAAAAD5A/gH8rxq6lybEgVRf119C5Hc4l_r2y8qBuQCLcB/s640/Absorption%2BSpectrum%2Bvs%2BAction%2BSpectrum.gif)

![Image result for oxygen production to flash energy](http://images.slideplayer.com/13/3922144/slides/slide_19.jpg)
$$
Quantum Yield = \frac{rate .of. O_2. production}{photons.absorbed}
$$
Emmerson was working with algae to measure quantum yield in relation to the absorption spectrum (the amount of energy produced by the plant per photon absorbed)

​	Discovered: **The Red Drop** -- Quantum Yield drops off precipitously towards 700 nm light

​			![Image result for emerson effect](https://redfarred.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Emerson-Effect-Image-300x236.png)

This led to the discovery that there are two photosystems

​	**PS 1**  --> 700 nm

​	**PS 2**  --> 680 nm

Light is only absorbed efficiently when both photosystems are functional



## Our Present Model of Light Reactions

### The Photosystems

![Image result for photosynthesis molecular diagram](http://philschatz.com/biology-concepts-book/resources/Figure_05_02_06.jpg)

If the Fd (Ferredoxin) brings the electron back to the cytochrome, it is *cyclic*.

- One place where cyclic photosynthesis occurs is in the bundle sheath cells of C4 plants, because they require more ATP than NADPH

*Note: PS 1 and 2 are not just right next to each other like in this diagram.*

								   ↓				PH 8 in stroma
	  							   H+
	  
````



### Cyclic vs. Non-Cyclic Photo

Cyclic -- requires just PS1, produces just ATP

Non-Cyclic -- requires PS2 and PS1, produces ATP and NADPH



#### Z-Scheme

![Image result for z scheme](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/lightreactionofphotosynthesis-160416123243/95/light-reaction-of-photosynthesis-17-638.jpg?cb=1460810047)

#### Why Chloroplasts Hide

In strong light, chloroplasts hide along the cell walls to protect themselves from damage caused by excessive light (it causes photo-inhibition because of damage) --> avoid creating Reactive Oxygen Species



### How the Photosystems Connect to the Calvin-Benson Cycle

![Image result for light reactions calvin cycle](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e2/97/1a/e2971a8a2f5e6c4af37ba60bf59efc1a.png)





## The Dark Reactions

(light-independent reactions) --> take more time to get going, **biochemical**

On paper you can do the dark reactions in the dark, but they require enzymes from the light reactions.

These take CO2 and H2O, produce (CH2O)n

![Image result for chlorella photosynthesis experiment](http://ib.bioninja.com.au/_Media/lollipop-experiment.jpeg)

![Image result for paper chromatography calvin cycle](http://6e.plantphys.net/ch/08/wt08.02/wt0802a.png)

The first product of carbon fixation reaction is a 3-carbon acid (3PGA) in C3 photosynthesis.

#### The three steps to the dark reaction

1. Carbon Fixation (aka carboxylation) (CO2 --> acids)
   1. `RuBP + CO2 --> 3PGA` (3-phosphoglycerate)
   2. This is the rate-limiting (slowest) step
   3. RUBISCO is RuBP-carboxylase/oxygenase
2. Sugar Formation (aka reduction) (acids --> sugars)
   1. Requires ATP and NADPH
   2. `3PGA + ATP + NADPH --> G3P (a sugar (triose-phosphate))`
3. RuBP Regeneration (aka regeneration) (Ribulose Bisphosphate reformed)
   1. `G3P + ATP --> RuBP + ADP`

![Image result for 8.3 the calvin cycle](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/08lecturepresentation-151018153441-lva1-app6892/95/biology-in-focus-chapter-8-87-638.jpg?cb=1445182657)





## Induction of Photosynthesis

### Response Curves

Redwood forest response curves -- Assimilation log up, conductance linear up, Ps linear up

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-3040.1984.tb01194.x

#### Rubisco Activation => CO2 --> `Carbamylation` Mg2+

Rubisco is the limiting factor for the rate of photosynthesis.

The light reaction restarts instantly (in a response curve) but dark takes some time to get started up.

`Light --> NADPH + ATP`

- Stromal environment goes from pH 7-->8, inside thylakoid pH 7-->6
  - To balance the charges, when H+ ions enter thylakoid from stroma, Mg2+ ions are released.



- Synthesis of intermediates (RuBP)
- Activation of Enzymes



#### Role of the Light Reaction

- Stromal pH 7 --> 8
- Exchange of Mg2+
- Ferredoxin as reducing agent (see below)
- CO2 up



#### The Ferredoxin--Thioredoxin System

![Image result for ferredoxin thioredoxin system](http://images.slideplayer.com/12/3375152/slides/slide_3.jpg)



#### Responses C3 vs C4

At higher CO2 concentrations and temperatures closer to ~45C, C3 approaches C4 in efficiency

### Photorespiration (O2/CO2 Competition)

C4 plants avoid this for the most part

#### High temps and low Stomatal Conductances

When PR is particularly costly.

Removal of O2 from Rubisco



3/4 of the carbons are recovered, but 1/4 are "lost" to the environment as CO2

Happens at higher temperatures --> at lower temps too, but not as costly

![Related image](http://images.slideplayer.com/12/3429712/slides/slide_8.jpg)



# C3 vs C4, yet again

```
C4:

PEP + dissolved CO2 ---{PEP carboxylase}-->> 4-C acid (Malate)

C3:

RubiscO oxygenates

					RuBP	  C3
				  ↙		↘	  ↓
		2x 2-C acid		 3-C 3PGA
			↓             |
		    4C     		  |
	 		↓			 ↓
	 	   3PGA	--------> lots of 3PGA
```



## C4

There is a spatial separation of carboxylation and sugar synthesis.

`Pep carboxylase` in the mesophyll carboxylates (doesn't oxygenate).  Malate, a C-4 acid, is then sent to the bundle sheath cells for sugar synthesis.

​	Avoids photorespiration, but takes more ATP --> evolved in warm, sunny areas.

​		--> higher photosynthesis rates than C3 at higher temperatures and drier conditions

​		--> you don't need as much nitrogen because you don't need as much enzyme

​			--> Nitrogen Use Efficiency is much higher



# CAM Photosynthesis

Cacti, Bromeliads, succulents, etc.

​	--> deserts, treetops, bare stone, etc.

​	--> GENERALLY: High light, low water

​		Very high water use efficiency and potentially a high carbon use efficiency

CAM -- ***temporal separation***

​	**Carboxylation during the night --> Stomata open @ night**

​	**Sugar formation during the day --> Stomata closed during the day**

​	It functions as a C3 plant in terms of light reactions during the day. 

​		Pep Carboxylase

```
                     PEP carboxylase
                            ↓
            PEP + CO2 --> malate --> stored in vacuoles over the course of the day
                                                ↓
                                    CO2 released into mesophyll cell
                                                ↓
                                    sugar formation during the day
```



# Phloem Transport -- Sap

## The Sugar Cycle

**Sugar** -- source to sink

​	**Sources:**  photosynthesis in leaves, roots (for carrots, sugar beets, etc.)

​	**Sinks:**       fruits, roots, new leaves --> anywhere with active metabolism/growth

​		 --> generally, sinks are places of rapid growth, which need sugar for respiration and for structure

**![img](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BdJqfmb1f7x12fNTS5Qg70Spv6vsSqUtES-4as89edU0nUaklJ0cwnA0ie510fHOoyxq2IUise7SshqURwpfbbSJn4XdBGGXu7UZ94VkEg-WpEaVvk672vF-DeWx_yGZ3ANeZwNNrDhl2szu9Q)**



**The sugar in question?**

#### Sucrose!

It is a disaccharide of `glucose + fructose`

Doesn't have a free aldehyde group so it is a non-reducing sugar (less reactive)

​	This is safer for the plant



### Living Cells of the Vascular Tissue

Contrast with xylem's dead vessel elements and tracheids

Called **sieve cells** or **sieve tube elements** --> these cells are *alive*

​	There are also associated cells called **companion cells**.

​		Since sieve cells don't have stuff cells normally have (like organelles), the companion cells aid them

​		Many plasmodesmata

​	Sieve cells lack nuclei

​	**Parenchyma cells** are undifferentiated Phloem tissue

**![img](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/mQN3MjvMImoTD7V1MdLjwIKcGr6_IhwnwpQ5KTT4vNCq54KlagTv85BrZ9BS5N7fdpcdpCvqbrIm77WmGpXKc5ZTk34K6edNwTsApondJlrWPSkC10-aBjQPFNuc4t4wuzQgHB_GZvO6pL7ixw)**

### Where is Phloem Located?

![img](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Y9FvS5_OWb5HfZwLNsbB9Gs1eE_in9u-qgQ8sEbrD9TzpOoR2SYXqPkEZ1xDWiq5z5SJixXz6WSGHg4MU_kowChJ0uZNPZ4Ca6iyU4hVilbb_R5_CLtKOmRT6FHOyoHEaJ8JpuoGHGiFgq8v5w)

Just inside the layer of bark.

**Girdling** a tree will kill it.



### How does sap move?

**Bulk Flow** -- movement of a mass of water under a pressure gradient

​	**Positive pressure gradient** --> turgor pressure



#### The Münch Pressure Flow Model (1930)

Phloem loading -- source cell producing sugar

Phloem unloading -- sink cell taking in sugar

**![img](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cDNfsRxO_Ubip1a82e4_JXI4OOdR5N0ub7l9KbsfAbBL_ftd7nqqrzygFNvY7vDpX9KbGx_kR3qun3LfKJV5Q8SG0qYwC6EuozQNeaPSvZKCEtUx0b8BZEtwQmke9kYBP63dHPBNJMPNK3Ynfg)**



​		How do they maintain this?

​		Negative water potential due to the solute (sugar).

P-protein (or "slime")

​	-- protective mechanism, plugs leaks in the phloem cells



## Companion Cells

There are standard, boring companion cells.  Then, there are...

### **Transfer Cells** 

​		-- they have wall ingrowths to give more surface area

​		-- **no** plasmodesmatal connections to bundle sheath

### **Intermediary Cells**

​		-- they have plasmodesmatal connections to bundle sheath cells (connected to Mesophyll cells)

Regular cells may have properties of these specialized cells



## There is more than just sugar

Source --> loading of sugar --> sieve cells --> Ψs --> water uptake goes up --> Ψp goes up

In intermediary cells, another glucose or two are added to the sucrose: makes it too big to move out the plasmodesmata it came in through, but small enough to go through the next one

# Environmental Signaling

## Plant Growth and Development

### Hormones

#### The Environment

The environment influences hormones influences growth and development leading to flowering.

##### Seasonality

*Plants live in a seasonal environment.*

​	-- Temperature is the seasonal queue around here

​	-- In the tropics, it's water.

​	-- Light is also an important queue

Going into and coming out of dormancy are critical.  Inactive state. --> prevent inappropriate growth under temporary favorable conditions (like a few warm days of winter).

**Stratification** of seeds = suspended animation --> seeds, required for exposure to low temps (freezing)

##### 	Dormancy

​		Endodormancy: when a meristem can't grow if provided with appropriate conditions

​		Paradormancy: when a meristem can grow, but is blocked by:

​			apical dominance (IAA)

​			seed coat inhibition -- waterproof seed coat keeps water out 

​				Scarification -- Being scratched, some plants need this

![Image result for seed coat](http://www.t5fixtures.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/large.jpg)

​		Ecodormancy: when a meristem can receive stratification yet still won't grow yet

​			waiting for the correct ecological conditions.

**Vernalization** --> flowers

​	ABA enforces dormancy

​	GA breaks dormancy

​		Arabidopsis study

​			Frigida (FRI) <-- functional or mutated

​				Enables expression of Flowering Locus Control (FLC) 

​					--> represses expression of "flowering genes"

## Light

Phototropism --> blue light --> Cryptochrome (CRY)

​	Some animals also have them

**Time**

**Intensity**

**On : Off**

**"Quality" --> Wavelength**



Responses:

​	growth response --> phototropism

​	stomatal opening <-- physiological

​	deetiolation <-- developmental

​		**etiolation** is

​			rapid elongation growth

​			dicot -- apical hook

​			no chlorophyll --> limited plastid development (red light response)

​			no anthocyanin -- blue pigment that acts like sunscreen to absorb light

Red Light -- seed germination and phytochrome response (reversible)

​	phytochrome is turned on by red light, off by far red light

​		It is a cis/trans change
