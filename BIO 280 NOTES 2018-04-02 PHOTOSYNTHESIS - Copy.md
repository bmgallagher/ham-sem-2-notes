## The W Questions

### Who?

Photoautotrophs

- Many bacteria such as cyanobacteria, purple sulfur, etc.

  - Endosymbotic theory -- prokaryotes were engulfed to become chloroplasts

- "Algae"

  - Multicellular -- red, brown, and green

- Protists

  - Euglena
  - Unicellular Eukaryotes

- Terrestrial Plants (duh)

  ​

### What?

- Conversion of light energy to chemical energy stored in sugar (byproduct O2)



### Where?

- Chloroplasts in leaf cells in air-filled leaves (air is needed)



### When?

- When is there light? --> Light reactions always during day
  - Dark reactions are also during day except in CAM plants, where carbon fixation part can happen in the dark.



### Why?

- Way back when it was found to be a good way to make a living (see *stromatolites* (cyanobacteria))



### How?

#### 	Light vs. Dark Reactions

- The Light-dependent (photochemical) reactions

  `H2O + Light + ADP + Pi + NADP+ --> ATP + NADPH + O2`

  - Light hits pigments, excites electrons, ETC to create usable chemical energy (ATP), eventually passed off to electron carriers (NADPH) (reducing agent)
  - H2O is consumed and O2 is produced as a byproduct of this reaction.

- The "Dark" or Light-independent (biochemical) reactions

  - The Calvin cycle -- Rubisco-mediated 
  - CO2 is consumed and sugar (stable form of chemical energy) is produced in this reaction


## The History of Photosynthesis

- x BC       Ancient Greeks (Aristotle) -- "animals need plants, plants don't need animals"

- 1600      Van Helmont experiment -- Grow plant, weigh soil --> plants don't gain body mass from soil

  - He concluded that the mass came from water.

- 1720's   Stephen Hales -- thought something from the air attributed to plant mass

- 1770's   Priestly -- Mouse/candle in bell jar → Phlogistation (contamination) of air (removal of oxygen)

  ​											→ Plants dephlogistated it

  ​		Ingenhousz -- Plants only dephlogistated it in the sunlight, just phlogistated it in the dark

  ​		Senebier -- 

- 1780's   Lavoisier -- An actual chemist, determined that Oxygen and CO2 are involved with the above ↑

  - Plants produce and animals consume O2, opposite with CO2

- 1800's   de Saussure -- Plant mass is from CO2 *and* something from water

- 1840's   von Mayer -- 

- 1860's   von Sachs -- 

- 1880's   Engelmann -- Prism --> *Spirogyra* cells --> found the wavelengths used by photosynthesis

  - Discovered the Action Spectrum (Variation in action due to wavelength)

    ![Image result for engelmann experiment](http://6e.plantphys.net/ch/07/wt07.01/wt0701d.jpg)

- 1900's   Blackman -- codified the idea that light and dark reactions were separate

  - The photochemical reactions are fast, and biochemical (CO2-limited) are slow

- 1930's   van Neil -- Purple sulfur bacteria (H2S --{light}-->> S2)

  - Thus, oxygenic photosynthesis must split water.

- 1941      Ruben & Kamen -- Radioactively labled Oxygen in water

  - shows that the source of oxygen released by plants was from water.

- 1954      Arnon -- Photophosphorylation

  - Chloroplasts produce ATP

## C3 vs C4 Photosynthesis

Brian Gallagher		    3 April 2018

------

### How C3 Photosynthesis Works

1.   CO2 + RUBP --> 2 x 3-Carbon acids

   ​		| RUBP is a 5-Carbon sugar w/ 2 Phosphates

2.   3-Carbon acid(Phosphate) ----{-ATP, -NADPH}-->> 3-Carbon sugar(Phosphate)

3.   3-Carbon sugar: one goes to product (Triose Phosphate), other goes to become RUBP



### How C4 Photosynthesis Works

- There is a spatial separation of carbon fixation and sugar formation

  - Carboxylation (Carbon fixation) happens in the mesophyll

    1. ​	CO2 + 3-Carbon --> 4-Carbon (Malic acid, etc.)
    2. ​        4-Carbon compound is sent to Bundle Sheath

  - Sugar formation is happening inside the bundle sheath cells of C4 plants

    - Very high CO2 concentration in bundle sheaths

**Difference between C3 and C4 Structure:**

![Image result for c3 vs c4 structure](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HbLg4lMpUa8/maxresdefault.jpg)

- The bundle sheath in the C4 plants are large cells with chloroplasts.
  - The difference in their Photosynthesis has to do with this
    - Triose Phosphate in C3 is released into the mesophyll cytoplasm, where it is turned into sucrose (the transport sugar) to be put into a vascular bundle for transport
      - No separation, so happens throughout the Mesophyll
    - The spatial separation in C4 causes

## Chloroplast Structure

## How does Light work?

![Image result for electromagnetic spectrum](https://cdn.miniphysics.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/electromagneticspectrum.jpg)

​		![Image result for chlorophyll light absorption spectrum](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ec7318f0497381d8b83290f0eeaa3b23-c)

- Pigments are molecules that absorb particular wavelengths of light

  - Chlorophyll structure: porphyrin ring with metal in the middle (Mg) --> looks a lot like hemoglobin
  - Long non-polar hydrophobic tail to bind it to the thylakoid membrane

- The radiant energy of the photon is converted into heat, etc. on hitting something

  - Pigment gets excited, and...

    1. ​	release energy as Heat

    2. ​        release energy as Fluorescence (light)

    3. ​        Photochemistry --> e- is lost, chlorophyll is oxidized

    4. ​        Resonance Transfer --> transfer of excited state (without transferring electrons)

       ![Image result for energy transfer during photosynthesis](http://www.tankonyvtar.hu/en/tartalom/tamop425/0010_1A_Book_angol_01_novenyelettan/images/img26.png)

### Spectra: Absorption & Action

![Image result for oxygen production to flash energy](http://images.slideplayer.com/13/3922144/slides/slide_19.jpg)
$$
Quantum Yield = \frac{rate .of. O_2. production}{photons.absorbed}
$$
Emmerson was working with algae to measure quantum yield in relation to the absorption spectrum (the amount of energy produced by the plant per photon absorbed)

​	Discovered: **The Red Drop** -- Quantum Yield drops off precipitously towards 700 nm light

​			![Image result for emerson effect](https://redfarred.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Emerson-Effect-Image-300x236.png)

This led to the discovery that there are two photosystems

​	**PS 1**  --> 700 nm

​	**PS 2**  --> 680 nm

Light is only absorbed efficiently when both photosystems are functional



## Our Present Model of Light Reactions

### The Photosystems

![Image result for photosynthesis molecular diagram](http://philschatz.com/biology-concepts-book/resources/Figure_05_02_06.jpg)

If the Fd (Ferredoxin) brings the electron back to the cytochrome, it is *cyclic*.

- One place where cyclic photosynthesis occurs is in the bundle sheath cells of C4 plants, because they require more ATP than NADPH

*Note: PS 1 and 2 are not just right next to each other like in this diagram.*

### Cyclic vs. Non-Cyclic Photo

Cyclic -- requires just PS1, produces just ATP

Non-Cyclic -- requires PS2 and PS1, produces ATP and NADPH



#### Z-Scheme

![Image result for z scheme](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/lightreactionofphotosynthesis-160416123243/95/light-reaction-of-photosynthesis-17-638.jpg?cb=1460810047)

#### Why Chloroplasts Hide

In strong light, chloroplasts hide along the cell walls to protect themselves from damage caused by excessive light (it causes photo-inhibition because of damage) --> avoid creating Reactive Oxygen Species



### How the Photosystems Connect to the Calvin-Benson Cycle

![Image result for light reactions calvin cycle](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e2/97/1a/e2971a8a2f5e6c4af37ba60bf59efc1a.png)





## The Dark Reactions

(light-independent reactions) --> take more time to get going, **biochemical**

On paper you can do the dark reactions in the dark, but they require enzymes from the light reactions.

These take CO2 and H2O, produce (CH2O)n

![Image result for chlorella photosynthesis experiment](http://ib.bioninja.com.au/_Media/lollipop-experiment.jpeg)

![Image result for paper chromatography calvin cycle](http://6e.plantphys.net/ch/08/wt08.02/wt0802a.png)

The first product of carbon fixation reaction is a 3-carbon acid (3PGA) in C3 photosynthesis.

#### The three steps to the dark reaction

1. Carbon Fixation (aka carboxylation) (CO2 --> acids)
   1. `RuBP + CO2 --> 3PGA` (3-phosphoglycerate)
   2. This is the rate-limiting (slowest) step
   3. RUBISCO is RuBP-carboxylase/oxygenase
2. Sugar Formation (aka reduction) (acids --> sugars)
   1. Requires ATP and NADPH
   2. `3PGA + ATP + NADPH --> G3P (a sugar (triose-phosphate))`
3. RuBP Regeneration (aka regeneration) (Ribulose Bisphosphate reformed)
   1. `G3P + ATP --> RuBP + ADP`

## Induction of Photosynthesis

### Response Curves

Redwood forest response curves -- Assimilation log up, conductance linear up, Ps linear up

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-3040.1984.tb01194.x

#### Rubisco Activation => CO2 --> `Carbamylation` Mg2+

Rubisco is the limiting factor for the rate of photosynthesis.

The light reaction restarts instantly (in a response curve) but dark takes some time to get started up.

`Light --> NADPH + ATP`

- Stromal environment goes from pH 7-->8, inside thylakoid pH 7-->6
  - To balance the charges, when H+ ions enter thylakoid from stroma, Mg2+ ions are released.



- Synthesis of intermediates (RuBP)
- Activation of Enzymes



#### Role of the Light Reaction

- Stromal pH 7 --> 8
- Exchange of Mg2+
- Ferredoxin as reducing agent (see below)
- CO2 up



#### The Ferredoxin--Thioredoxin System

![Image result for ferredoxin thioredoxin system](http://images.slideplayer.com/12/3375152/slides/slide_3.jpg)



#### Responses C3 vs C4

At higher CO2 concentrations and temperatures closer to ~45C, C3 approaches C4 in efficiency

### Photorespiration (O2/CO2 Competition)

C4 plants avoid this for the most part

#### High temps and low Stomatal Conductances

When PR is particularly costly.

Removal of O2 from Rubisco



3/4 of the carbons are recovered, but 1/4 are "lost" to the environment as CO2

Happens at higher temperatures --> at lower temps too, but not as costly

C4:

PEP + dissolved CO2 ---{PEP carboxylase}-->> 4-C acid (Malate)

C3:
