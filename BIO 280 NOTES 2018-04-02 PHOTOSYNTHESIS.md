## The W Questions

### Who?

Photoautotrophs

- Many bacteria such as cyanobacteria, purple sulfur, etc.

  - Endosymbotic theory -- prokaryotes were engulfed to become chloroplasts

- "Algae"

  - Multicellular -- red, brown, and green

- Protists

  - Euglena
  - Unicellular Eukaryotes

- Terrestrial Plants (duh)

  ​

### What?

- Conversion of light energy to chemical energy stored in sugar (byproduct O2)



### Where?

- Chloroplasts in leaf cells in air-filled leaves (air is needed)



### When?

- When is there light? --> Light reactions always during day
  - Dark reactions are also during day except in CAM plants, where carbon fixation part can happen in the dark.



### Why?

- Way back when it was found to be a good way to make a living (see *stromatolites* (cyanobacteria))



### How?

#### 	Light vs. Dark Reactions

- The Light-dependent (photochemical) reactions

  `H2O + Light + ADP + Pi + NADP+ --> ATP + NADPH + O2`

  - Light hits pigments, excites electrons, ETC to create usable chemical energy (ATP), eventually passed off to electron carriers (NADPH) (reducing agent)
  - H2O is consumed and O2 is produced as a byproduct of this reaction.

- The "Dark" or Light-independent (biochemical) reactions

  - The Calvin cycle -- Rubisco-mediated 
  - CO2 is consumed and sugar (stable form of chemical energy) is produced in this reaction


## The History of Photosynthesis

- x BC       Ancient Greeks (Aristotle) -- "animals need plants, plants don't need animals"

- 1600      Van Helmont experiment -- Grow plant, weigh soil --> plants don't gain body mass from soil

  - He concluded that the mass came from water.

- 1720's   Stephen Hales -- thought something from the air attributed to plant mass

- 1770's   Priestly -- Mouse/candle in bell jar → Phlogistation (contamination) of air (removal of oxygen)

  ​											→ Plants dephlogistated it

  ​		Ingenhousz -- Plants only dephlogistated it in the sunlight, just phlogistated it in the dark

  ​		Senebier -- 

- 1780's   Lavoisier -- An actual chemist, determined that Oxygen and CO2 are involved with the above ↑

  - Plants produce and animals consume O2, opposite with CO2

- 1800's   de Saussure -- Plant mass is from CO2 *and* something from water

- 1840's   von Mayer -- 

- 1860's   von Sachs -- 

- 1880's   Engelmann -- Prism --> *Spirogyra* cells --> found the wavelengths used by photosynthesis

  - Discovered the Action Spectrum (Variation in action due to wavelength)

    ![Image result for engelmann experiment](http://6e.plantphys.net/ch/07/wt07.01/wt0701d.jpg)

- 1900's   Blackman -- codified the idea that light and dark reactions were separate

  - The photochemical reactions are fast, and biochemical (CO2-limited) are slow

- 1930's   van Neil -- Purple sulfur bacteria (H2S --{light}-->> S2)

  - Thus, oxygenic photosynthesis must split water.

- 1941      Ruben & Kamen -- Radioactively labled Oxygen in water

  - shows that the source of oxygen released by plants was from water.

- 1954      Arnon -- Photophosphorylation

  - Chloroplasts produce ATP

## C3 vs C4 Photosynthesis

------

### How C3 Works

1.   CO2 + RUBP --> 2 x 3-Carbon acids

   ​		| RUBP is a 5-Carbon sugar w/ 2 Phosphates

2.   3-Carbon acid(Phosphate) ----{-ATP, -NADPH}-->> 3-Carbon sugar(Phosphate)

3.   3-Carbon sugar: one goes to product (Triose Phosphate), other goes to become RUBP



### How C4 Photosynthesis Works

- There is a spatial separation of carbon fixation and sugar formation

  - Carboxylation (Carbon fixation) happens in the mesophyll

    1. ​	CO2 + 3-Carbon --> 4-Carbon (Malic acid, etc.)
    2. ​        4-Carbon compound is sent to Bundle Sheath

  - Sugar formation is happening inside the bundle sheath cells of C4 plants

    - Very high CO2 concentration in bundle sheaths

**Difference between C3 and C4 Structure:**

![Image result for c3 vs c4 structure](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HbLg4lMpUa8/maxresdefault.jpg)

- The bundle sheath in the C4 plants are large cells with chloroplasts.
  - The difference in their Photosynthesis has to do with this
    - Triose Phosphate in C3 is released into the mesophyll cytoplasm, where it is turned into sucrose (the transport sugar) to be put into a vascular bundle for transport
      - No separation, so happens throughout the Mesophyll
    - The spatial separation in C4 causes

## How does Light work?

- Pigments are molecules that absorb particular wavelengths of light
  - Chlorophyll structure: porphyrin ring with metal in the middle (Mg) --> looks a lot like hemoglobin
  - Long non-polar hydrophobic tail to bind it to the thylakoid membrane
- The radiant energy of the photon is converted into heat, etc. on hitting something
  - Pigment gets excited, and...
    1. ​	release energy as Heat
    2. ​        release energy as Fluorescence (light)
